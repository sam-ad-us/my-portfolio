/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset supports a public-facing portfolio application.
 * Most data, such as projects and skills, is publicly readable. Write access
 * is strictly controlled and granted only to a designated administrator.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: A specific Firebase Auth UID is designated as the administrator.
 *   This user has full create, update, and delete permissions on content collections.
 * - Public Read-Only Content: The /projects and /skills collections are publicly
 *   readable but writable only by the admin.
 * - User Profile Ownership: User profiles are publicly readable, but a user can
 *   only write to their own profile document.
 * - Private "Drop-Box": The /contact_messages collection allows anyone to create
 *   a message, but no one can read them via the client, ensuring privacy.
